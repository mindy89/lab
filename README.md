-For temp(from GENE): 

Conserved sites of miRNA on Target Scan which was written by order.  

-For survival.sample:

KRAS stands for gene; PAAD stands for project.  
  
Replace it with (KRAS, LUAD); (EGFR, LUAD); (EGFR, HNSC); (HER2, BRCA); (BRAF, SKCM); (MET, LUAD)...

-For survival curve with significance:

(BRAF, SKCM) has no significance in survival curve, thus skip for control(without mutation) and scatter plot.
